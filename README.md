## Maze of the Boar King

Explore a dark 3D labyrinth while a relentless pig-man stalks you. Collect all nine glowing peanuts, manage your stamina, and escape before he catches you.

### How to play

- Open `Index.html` in a modern desktop browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended).
- Click **Enter the Maze** and grant pointer lock to use the mouse for looking around.
- Move with **W A S D** (or arrow keys), hold **Shift** to sprint while watching the stamina bar.
- Walk over peanuts to collect themâ€”gather all nine to win.
- Avoid the Boar King: if he reaches you, you lose and face his jump scare.
- If the mouse cursor reappears, click inside the game window to recapture it.

For best immersion, play in a dark room with headphones.
